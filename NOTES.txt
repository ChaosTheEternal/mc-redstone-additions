Ideas for:
    Signal Extended Observer
    * Can I hide the "countdown" property?  Or make it truly a private property of the block?

    Glaze Container
    * Need to lift @error's Illusion Block: https://bitbucket.org/errorx666/tdwtf-minecraft/src/d6b10a9a64efb2417e32df50a21e067e421652fd/src/main/java/net/error_unlimited/tdwtf_minecraft/blocks/IllusionBlock.java?at=master
        * Main differences:
            * This block is always solid, even when filled
            * IDEA: Once filled, it stops allowing player interactions (so placing blocks against it doesn't require right clicking)
        * Only lifting the "emulated block" stuff, all the other container logic I need to do stock using MCP mappings
            * Likely need to rewrite the whole damn thing using a stock TileEntity implement INamedContainerProvider instead of using LockedTileEntity
        * How can I get it to use the emulated block's model when filled?
            * I'll have to see how @error did it, hopefully without the same lighting issues

    Directed Redstone Wiring / Redstone Rod
    * Like an end rod
        * Since 1.16.2 changed chains to be placable like end rods without light... can just fall back to "like an end rod"
        * That would mean I don't have to worry about branching or linking to redstone
            * Though if I were to "do it like a chain" that could mean allowing these to be waterlogged
            * Need to check the pre release, do chains break when hit by flowing water?
    * It is powered by/powering any blocks they are attached to
        * Don't receive or give off power any other way
        * Scrapping idea (for now) to connect into redstone dust if placed facing up/down
    * Works like redstone dust and has signal drop-off
        * Do I then need to consider a "vertical redstone repeater" to help with this?
    * FOR LATER CONSIDERATION: If it has a solid block underneath and is facing up, it also can be hooked into redstone dust along the ground
        * Can I also have it tie to redstone dust at higher levels adjacent to the vertical wiring?
    * Recipe?
        * If it is like an end rod... could just do the end rod recipe but add in redstone dust?
            * Blaze Rod + Popped Chorus Fruit + Redstone Dust
                * 1 Dust for 4 Redstone Rods?  Or 4 Dust for 4 Redstone Rods?
            * End Rod + Redstone Dust
        * Or should I give an option that is easier to get early on?
            * 3 Redstone Dust in a line
        * Why not both?  But make the version using end rod components give more than just using redstone dust

    Configurable Pistons
    * Will have an interface when interacted with, like a chest or furnace
    * On one side, you can put in (up to 4? or more?) sticks/pistons/whatever to specify how far the piston extends
    * On the other, you can put in up to the same number of slime balls/slime blocks to specify how many blocks in a line it can pull
    * The piston face will either need a specific graphic to support both or I'll have to see if you can override the model or a texture
        * If no slime, use the regular piston face, if slime, use the sticky piston face
    * Don't know if I can "fix" it so redstone dust doesn't break when the piston state changes and the dust is on any side except the front
        * Meaning, the dust is going along the side or back, obviously it should break if it's on the side that pushes
    * Recipe?
        * Should it be as "cheap" as a normal piston or have some other cost in place of the redstone dust or iron ingot?
