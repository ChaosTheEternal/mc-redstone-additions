Ideas for:
    Signal Extended Observer
    * Can I hide the "countdown" property?  Or make it truly a private property of the block?

    Glaze Container
    * Need to lift @error's Illusion Block: https://bitbucket.org/errorx666/tdwtf-minecraft/src/d6b10a9a64efb2417e32df50a21e067e421652fd/src/main/java/net/error_unlimited/tdwtf_minecraft/blocks/IllusionBlock.java?at=master
        * Main differences:
            * This block is always solid, even when filled
            * IDEA: Once filled, it stops allowing player interactions (so placing blocks against it doesn't require right clicking)
        * Only lifting the "emulated block" stuff, all the other container logic I need to do stock using MCP mappings
            * Likely need to rewrite the whole damn thing using a stock TileEntity implement INamedContainerProvider instead of using LockedTileEntity
        * How can I get it to use the emulated block's model when filled?
            * I'll have to see how @error did it, hopefully without the same lighting issues

    Vertical Redstone Wiring
    * Like an end rod (except vertical only) or chain in how it can be placed
    * If it has a solid block underneath, it also can be hooked into redstone dust along the ground
        * How can I have it tie to redstone dust at higher levels adjacent to the vertical wiring?
        * Or should I just leave it as strongly powering whatever block is at the top and let the player deal with it?
    * Can only give power up and down, except for the "bottom" block can give it in all directions
        * Can look at the Redstone Dust logic for how to determine the "hit" area for this base block
    * Works like redstone dust otherwise and has signal drop-off
        * Do I then need to consider a "vertical redstone repeater" to help with this?
    * Recipe?
        * Maybe consider making this like the 1.16 chain, may actually make it use the chain recipe but sub in redstone dust in place of the iron nuggets.
        * Or, should I put the dust in place of the ingot, so it's fairly cheap and makes more sense why it would break on any hit like redstone dust?
        * If I want to go the "chain" route, then I'm either pseudo backporting the chain to 1.15.2, or just holding the mod until Forge 1.16.2

    Configurable Pistons
    * Will have an interface when interacted with, like a chest or furnace
    * On one side, you can put in (up to 4? or more?) sticks/pistons/whatever to specify how far the piston extends
    * On the other, you can put in up to the same number of slime balls/slime blocks to specify how many blocks in a line it can pull
    * The piston face will either need a specific graphic to support both or I'll have to see if you can override the model or a texture
        * If no slime, use the regular piston face, if slime, use the sticky piston face
    * Don't know if I can "fix" it so redstone dust doesn't break when the piston state changes and the dust is on any side except the front
        * Meaning, the dust is going along the side or back, obviously it should break if it's on the side that pushes
    * Recipe?
        * Should it be as "cheap" as a normal piston or have some other cost in place of the redstone dust or iron ingot?
