# Redstone Additions
A Forge mod for Minecraft 1.15.2.  The intent is to add new blocks to assist and condense certain redstone circuits into single blocks.

## Requirements
Minecraft Forge version 1.15.2-31.2.0.  Later versions should work barring any breaking changes by the Forge team.

## Additions
### Redstone Inverter
A single block replacement for converting an on signal to off, originally by feeding a redstone line into a redstone torch attached to a block to turn the torch off.

### Instant Off Redstone Repeater
A redstone repeater modification that acts like a normal unlocked redstone repeater when getting power, but with the minimum delay power stops.
May revisit the ability to lock this repeater at a later date.

## Planned Additions
### Vertical Redstone Wiring
Some option to make running redstone vertically (up and down) easier and more compact.

### Extended Pistons
Pistons (and sticky pistons) with more than one block of reach.  Possibly also, for the sticky pistons, some logic to also pull multiple blocks.
